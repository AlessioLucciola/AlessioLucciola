# :raising_hand_man: About me

I'm <strong>Alessio Lucciola</strong>, a 24-year-old <strong>Software Engineer</strong> from Italy.
From an early age Iâ€™ve always been deeply interested in computing, in fact I've got a <strong>Computer Science Bachelor's Degree</strong> in March 2022 and I'm currently getting a <strong>Master's Degree in Sapienza - University Of Rome</strong>.
I'm particularly interested in developing Web Applications even though I'm always experimenting with new technologies and tools in order to come out with cool projects (especially if they concern AI).
