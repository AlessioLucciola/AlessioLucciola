# :raising_hand_man: About me

I'm <strong>Alessio Lucciola</strong>, a 24-year-old <strong>Software Engineer</strong> from Italy.
From an early age I’ve always been deeply interested in computing, in fact I've got a <strong>Computer Science Bachelor's Degree</strong> in March 2022 and I'm currently getting a <strong>Master's Degree in Sapienza - University Of Rome</strong>.
I'm particularly interested in developing <strong>Web Applications</strong> even though I'm always experimenting with new technologies and tools in order to come out with cool projects (especially if they concern <strong>AI</strong>).

# :muscle: Skills
Some languages I worked with are:
- Python
- Go (Golang)
- Java
- Javascript / Typescript
- PHP
- HTML / CSS

When developing Web Applications, I often make use of:
- ReactJS
- Bootstrap

Concerning the back-end, I used some technologies such as:
- Django
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
